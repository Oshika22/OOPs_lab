    "Question: Create a class Person with attributes name and age, and a method display() that prints the name and age. Then, create a subclass Student that inherits from Person and adds an attribute student_id. Write a method show_details() in Student to print all details, including student_id.\n",

Further, create another subclass ElectricCar that inherits from Car and adds a method battery_info() to print \"This car has a battery.\" Demonstrate how multilevel inheritance works by calling all methods from an ElectricCar object.\n",

Then, create a subclass TutorAuthor that inherits from both Teacher and Author. Use this subclass to call the description() method from each parent class. Use the super() function to resolve any conflicts if necessary.\n",
